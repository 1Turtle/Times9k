# Times9k
A small **4x9px** font reminiscent of the old days of win9k. (Format: **.BDF** / **.TTF**)
  
This font was originally created for private use. Among other things for GUI APIs or for the use of small screens controlled by Arduino's.  
But since I find this font very pretty, I decided to publish it now.
